PART 2. THE LEGISLATURE
1. Senate; house of representatives; members; special session upon petition of members;
congressional and legislative boundaries; citizen commissions
 Section 1. (1) The senate shall be composed of one member elected from each of the
thirty legislative districts established pursuant to this section.
The house of representatives shall be composed of two members elected from each of the
thirty legislative districts established pursuant to this section.
(2) Upon the presentation to the governor of a petition bearing the signatures of not less
than two-thirds of the members of each house, requesting a special session of the
legislature and designating the date of convening, the governor shall promptly call a
special session to assemble on the date specified. At a special session so called the
subjects which may be considered by the legislature shall not be limited.
(3) By February 28 of each year that ends in one, an independent redistricting
commission shall be established to provide for the redistricting of congressional and state
legislative districts. The independent redistricting commission shall consist of five
members. No more than two members of the independent redistricting commission shall
be members of the same political party. Of the first four members appointed, no more
than two shall reside in the same county. Each member shall be a registered Arizona
voter who has been continuously registered with the same political party or registered as
unaffiliated with a political party for three or more years immediately preceding
appointment, who is committed to applying the provisions of this section in an honest,
independent and impartial fashion and to upholding public confidence in the integrity of
the redistricting process. Within the three years previous to appointment, members shall
not have been appointed to, elected to, or a candidate for any other public office,
including precinct committeeman or committeewoman but not including school board
member or officer, and shall not have served as an officer of a political party, or served as
a registered paid lobbyist or as an officer of a candidate's campaign committee.
(4) The commission on appellate court appointments shall nominate candidates for
appointment to the independent redistricting commission, except that, if a politically
balanced commission exists whose members are nominated by the commission on
appellate court appointments and whose regular duties relate to the elective process, the
commission on appellate court appointments may delegate to such existing commission
(hereinafter called the commission on appellate court appointments' designee) the duty of
nominating members for the independent redistricting commission, and all other duties
assigned to the commission on appellate court appointments in this section.
(5) By January 8 of years ending in one, the commission on appellate court appointments
or its designee shall establish a pool of persons who are willing to serve on and are
qualified for appointment to the independent redistricting commission. The pool of
candidates shall consist of twenty-five nominees, with ten nominees from each of the two
largest political parties in Arizona based on party registration, and five who are not
registered with either of the two largest political parties in Arizona.
(6) Appointments to the independent redistricting commission shall be made in the order
set forth below. No later than January 31 of years ending in one, the highest ranking
officer elected by the Arizona house of representatives shall make one appointment to the
independent redistricting commission from the pool of nominees, followed by one 
appointment from the pool made in turn by each of the following: the minority party
leader of the Arizona house of representatives, the highest ranking officer elected by the
Arizona senate, and the minority party leader of the Arizona senate. Each such official
shall have a seven-day period in which to make an appointment. Any official who fails to
make an appointment within the specified time period will forfeit the appointment
privilege. In the event that there are two or more minority parties within the house or the
senate, the leader of the largest minority party by statewide party registration shall make
the appointment.
(7) Any vacancy in the above four independent redistricting commission positions
remaining as of March 1 of a year ending in one shall be filled from the pool of nominees
by the commission on appellate court appointments or its designee. The appointing body
shall strive for political balance and fairness.
(8) At a meeting called by the secretary of state, the four independent redistricting
commission members shall select by majority vote from the nomination pool a fifth
member who shall not be registered with any party already represented on the
independent redistricting commission and who shall serve as chair. If the four
commissioners fail to appoint a fifth member within fifteen days, the commission on
appellate court appointments or its designee, striving for political balance and fairness,
shall appoint a fifth member from the nomination pool, who shall serve as chair.
(9) The five commissioners shall then select by majority vote one of their members to
serve as vice-chair.
(10) After having been served written notice and provided with an opportunity for a
response, a member of the independent redistricting commission may be removed by the
governor, with the concurrence of two-thirds of the senate, for substantial neglect of duty,
gross misconduct in office, or inability to discharge the duties of office.
(11) If a commissioner or chair does not complete the term of office for any reason, the
commission on appellate court appointments or its designee shall nominate a pool of
three candidates within the first thirty days after the vacancy occurs. The nominees shall
be of the same political party or status as was the member who vacated the office at the
time of his or her appointment, and the appointment other than the chair shall be made by
the current holder of the office designated to make the original appointment. The
appointment of a new chair shall be made by the remaining commissioners. If the
appointment of a replacement commissioner or chair is not made within fourteen days
following the presentation of the nominees, the commission on appellate court
appointments or its designee shall make the appointment, striving for political balance
and fairness. The newly appointed commissioner shall serve out the remainder of the
original term.
(12) Three commissioners, including the chair or vice-chair, constitute a quorum. Three
or more affirmative votes are required for any official action. Where a quorum is present,
the independent redistricting commission shall conduct business in meetings open to the
public, with 48 or more hours public notice provided.
(13) A commissioner, during the commissioner's term of office and for three years
thereafter, shall be ineligible for Arizona public office or for registration as a paid
lobbyist.
(14) The independent redistricting commission shall establish congressional and
legislative districts. The commencement of the mapping process for both the 
congressional and legislative districts shall be the creation of districts of equal population
in a grid-like pattern across the state. Adjustments to the grid shall then be made as
necessary to accommodate the goals as set forth below:
A. Districts shall comply with the United States Constitution and the United States voting
rights act;
B. Congressional districts shall have equal population to the extent practicable, and state
legislative districts shall have equal population to the extent practicable;
C. Districts shall be geographically compact and contiguous to the extent practicable;
D. District boundaries shall respect communities of interest to the extent practicable;
E. To the extent practicable, district lines shall use visible geographic features, city, town
and county boundaries, and undivided census tracts;
F. To the extent practicable, competitive districts should be favored where to do so would
create no significant detriment to the other goals.
(15) Party registration and voting history data shall be excluded from the initial phase of
the mapping process but may be used to test maps for compliance with the above goals.
The places of residence of incumbents or candidates shall not be identified or considered.
(16) The independent redistricting commission shall advertise a draft map of
congressional districts and a draft map of legislative districts to the public for comment,
which comment shall be taken for at least thirty days. Either or both bodies of the
legislature may act within this period to make recommendations to the independent
redistricting commission by memorial or by minority report, which recommendations
shall be considered by the independent redistricting commission. The independent
redistricting commission shall then establish final district boundaries.
(17) The provisions regarding this section are self-executing. The independent
redistricting commission shall certify to the secretary of state the establishment of
congressional and legislative districts.
(18) Upon approval of this amendment, the department of administration or its successor
shall make adequate office space available for the independent redistricting commission.
The treasurer of the state shall make $6,000,000 available for the work of the independent
redistricting commission pursuant to the year 2000 census. Unused monies shall be
returned to the state's general fund. In years ending in eight or nine after the year 2001,
the department of administration or its successor shall submit to the legislature a
recommendation for an appropriation for adequate redistricting expenses and shall make
available adequate office space for the operation of the independent redistricting
commission. The legislature shall make the necessary appropriations by a majority vote.
(19) The independent redistricting commission, with fiscal oversight from the department
of administration or its successor, shall have procurement and contracting authority and
may hire staff and consultants for the purposes of this section, including legal
representation.
(20) The independent redistricting commission shall have standing in legal actions
regarding the redistricting plan and the adequacy of resources provided for the operation
of the independent redistricting commission. The independent redistricting commission
shall have sole authority to determine whether the Arizona attorney general or counsel
hired or selected by the independent redistricting commission shall represent the people
of Arizona in the legal defense of a redistricting plan. 
(21) Members of the independent redistricting commission are eligible for reimbursement
of expenses pursuant to law, and a member's residence is deemed to be the member's post
of duty for purposes of reimbursement of expenses.
(22) Employees of the department of administration or its successor shall not influence or
attempt to influence the district-mapping decisions of the independent redistricting
commission.
(23) Each commissioner's duties established by this section expire upon the appointment
of the first member of the next redistricting commission. The independent redistricting
commission shall not meet or incur expenses after the redistricting plan is completed,
except if litigation or any government approval of the plan is pending, or to revise
districts if required by court decisions or if the number of congressional or legislative
districts is changed.
