Redistricting in Wisconsin is under the control of the state legislature. If the state legislature fails to reach 
an agreement, the maps are drawn by either state or federal courts. The State Senate and State Assembly draft maps 
for the new state legislative districts and the U.S. Congressional districts. Both chambers must pass the new map, 
and the governor can sign or veto the map for any reason.

2010
According to the 2010 U.S. Census, Wisconsin's population increased from 5.36 million to 5.69 million between 2000 
and 2010. This population growth was large enough to allow the state to retain its eight Congressional seats.

Republicans held the majority in the State Senate, State Assembly, and the governorship after the 2010 elections. 
As a result, the redistricting process was completely under the control of one party.

The Republican leadership dismissed the Democratic-hired firm that was going to aid with redistricting and instead 
brought in an outside group to aid the process. This new firm's leader had donated to Republican candidates in the 
past. The redistricting process was accelerated by the summer 2011 recall elections, and Governor Scott Walker 
signed a bill that gave the legislature the power to redistrict state boundaries before the localities finished 
their redistricting processes. The state Republicans unveiled their plan on July 8, 2011. Democrats criticized the 
plan as gerrymandering, but Republicans defended their map. The maps passed the legislature on July 19, 2011, and 
signed into law by Governor Walker on August 9, 2011.

Several lawsuits were filed as a result of the new maps. The Wisconsin Government Accountability Board identified 
errors in the maps, likely due to the creation of the state boundaries before the localities finished drawing their 
boundaries. A court also determined that two Milwaukee-area districts needed to be redrawn to better represent 
minority-area populations.
